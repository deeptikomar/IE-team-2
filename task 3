1. Secure File Sharing Module

Description:
This module allows users to securely share uploaded files with others using encrypted, time-limited links.
The system ensures that only authorized recipients can access shared files through password protection and expiry settings.

Purpose:
To enhance collaboration between users while maintaining security and privacy.
It enables easy file distribution without downloading or re-uploading files manually.

Integration:
A “Share” button is added beside each file in the dashboard. When clicked, a popup lets users generate a secure link and optionally set an expiry time or password.
The backend encrypts the link data and validates it before allowing downloads.


2. Version Control & File History Module

Description:
This module maintains a history of uploaded files, storing each updated version separately.
Users can view, compare, or revert to previous file versions anytime.

Purpose:
To prevent accidental data loss and make it easier for users to recover or review older versions of their files,
improving reliability and user control.

Integration:
Each file in the dashboard includes a “History” icon. Clicking it opens a popup displaying version numbers, timestamps, and size details.
The backend links multiple file versions under the same file ID and handles retrieval of the selected version.


3. Cloud Health & Usage Analytics Module

Description:
A visual analytics dashboard that shows statistics like total storage used, number of uploaded files, 
cloud distribution, and activity trends (uploads/downloads per week).

Purpose:
To improve transparency and help users (and admins) understand storage usage patterns and cloud performance.
Encourages efficient cloud resource management.

Integration:
Adds a new “Analytics” tab in the user dashboard.
The backend collects metadata from uploaded files and generates charts (pie charts for storage, bar graphs for upload trends).
Frontend uses libraries like Chart.js or Plotly for visualization.
